<h2>Stories from all walks of life</h2>
<p>
The Collector is a platform with stories written by you. Reach thousands with your stories regardless of being a writer or having a standalone story.
</p>
<br>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
The Collector focuses on stories of everyday life. That changes with everyone. Our aim is to bring together people of different perspectives and adding professional opinions to our more serious topics. We cover anything from the pleasure of enjoying a coffee in the bustling city of Berlin to life as a minority or personal experiences with difficult family members.
Submit your stories to the Collector where we will use your stories as a whole or as a part of a collection where it can be viewed by the public. Your stories will be minimally edited, with you seeing the final version before it gets published and your original story being cited in the article.
While submitting, you can also turn on the option to post your story on the Collector's Public Domain, a more informal version of the Collector, where your story is in your hands and your hands only.
