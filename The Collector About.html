We are a team of writers who are passionate with stories that connect every individual's experiences. We realized that it can be hard to find people with similar experiences around you. You might feel crazy or disconnected because of the mix of feelings you cannot decipher on your own. We'd like to offer any help we can by getting rid of the borders of writing.
